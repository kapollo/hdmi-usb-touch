A user-space "driver" for a touchscreen device that has an HDMI input and a
separate USB connection for the touch events.

When the USB is plugged in, Linux reports:

	hid-generic 0003:0EEF:0005.0004: hiddev0,hidraw2: USB HID v1.10 Device [RPI_TOUCH By ZH851] on usb-0000:00:14.0-2/input0

The code uses libudev0 to detect the touchscreen device and find from where
its events can be read (hidraw). It creates a virtual input device (uinput,
this is from the point of view of the kernel). It then spends the rest of its
time reading touch events from the hidraw device, converting and pushing them
to the kernel via the virtual uinput device it created earlier.
